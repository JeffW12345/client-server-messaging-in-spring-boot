# Client-Server messaging service

Two clients are created, each running on their own threads. The clients each send a message to the server, which
broadcasts a message back to them.

I developed this app as a 'sandpit' exercise to explore how I could set up client-server messaging with Spring Boot on a
more complicated project. 

Uses WebSocket.
